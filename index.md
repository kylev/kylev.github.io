This is where I keep [my code](https://github.com/kylev). I do a lot
of back-end stuff, but I did build a [penmanship and calligraphy
practice page](/pen/) generator as an exercise in simple, open,
single-purpose GitHub Pages apps. I also wrote [Talk
Piggy](/talk-piggy/) for tracking who is doing the talking in a
meeting or call.
